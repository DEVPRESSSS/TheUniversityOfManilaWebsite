            <h2>Overview of High School and Elementary Department</h2>
            <p>The High School and Elementary Department of The University of Manila is considered the oldest unit of this one hundred year old institution of learning, having been opened in the school year 1914-1915. It was started with the purpose of affording an economical opportunity to the youths of Manila and other parts of the Philippines to obtain a thorough education at pre-collegiate levels.</p>
            <p>Physical Education classes are held at the new Physical Education Building which construction reflects the University’s vibrance and relevance as an educational institution attuned to the needs of the 21st century.</p>
            <p>Character development is stressed not only in the classrooms but also in all aspects of the curricular and extra-curricular programs participated in by the students. The Department is aware of the fact that majority of the students enrolled in the Elementary and High School levels are in the most critical period of their lives, that of adolescence.</p>
            <p>Hence, every opportunity is given the students to improve themselves morally, spiritually, and intellectually. Through a well conducted guidance program, students are encouraged to face the future unafraid.</p>

                    <p>The College of Liberal Arts of the University of Manila was opened in the school year 1920-1921. It teaches not only the principally courses traditionally embraced by the humanities and social sciences but also trains the students in the skills of a liberal education: learning, reading and writing, and thinking critically in the broad fields of liberal learning- the arts, science, society, philosophy, and religion.</p>
                    
                    <p>Specifically, through a balanced curriculum and a varied but unified program of extra-curricular activities, it aims:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>To train students in correct and creative thinking, judicious appraisal of contemporary problems, effective communication and aesthetic as well as ethical discrimination of values;</li>
                        <li>To give a wide and intensive cultural background preparatory to later professional training in Law, Education, Foreign Service, Business Administration, Public Administration, Military Science or in any other field;</li>
                        <li>To acquaint the students with the significant facts, basic and unifying principles as well as the chief methods of research in the four major areas of human knowledge, namely, the Natural and Social Sciences, Mathematics and the Humanities (with Philosophy, the integrating master science, included);</li>
                        <li>To interest students in the study of research possibilities that are relevant to conditions prevailing in our country.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>On August 3, 2003, the University created history once more, as it received a government permit to offer a four-year Bachelor of Arts in Cultural Languages major in Japanese Language, making the University of Manila the very first institution of higher learning to offer a degree program in Japanese Language.</p>

                    <p>The College of Business Administration of the University opened in the school year 1922-23. It aims:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>To train business leaders and executives prepared to cope with the manifold problems of business and industry brought about by the dislocation of Philippine economy;</li>
                        <li>To help in the stabilization of the national economic system;</li>
                        <li>To give an essential cultural background and a thorough familiarity with general business facts, principles, and practices which are necessary in preparing for effective business administration and leadership;</li>

                    </ol>
                    
                    <p>After his release from foreign domination in 1946, the Filipino has become fully cognizant of the imperative need for broadening his sphere of economic activities, and of taking greater participation in the industrial and commercial development of his country. Now more vigorous and economically militant than ever before, he has become realistic of the fact that he cannot remain indifferent to his economic welfare and allow foreign minds and capital to monopolize the country's industrial and commercial resources. Conscious of this economic awakening, the College of Business Administration of the University of Manila has been leaving no stone unturned to help produce minds trained to cope with the needs of the country's development. This college offers the following major fields of studies, namely Accounting, Banking and Finance, Management, Marketing and Economics. It is now staffed with more qualified professors and better library and other facilities.</p>
                    
                    <p>In recognition of the quality standards and practices of the College of Business Administration and Accountancy, the Philippine Association of Colleges and Universities-Commission on Accreditation or PACUCOA, a member of the Federation of Accrediting Agencies in the Philippines or FAAP, conferred Level II Re accreditation status to its B.S. Business Administration program.</p>

                <div class="admission-section">
                    <p>The preservation of high ideals has always been-in the history of every institution-a glorious tradition. This is so because it is in this intellectual inheritance where the worth of a college is put into test. Thus, the College of Law of the University of Manila can be mightily proud of her past which is studded with meritorious achievements.</p>
                    
                    <p>On March 12, 1919, the College of Law was organized and was given government recognition on November 1, 1920. It was formally incorporated into the University during the academic year 1921-1922. Barely after two years of its founding, the College of Law caught public attention and gained popular acclaim when two of its graduates: Pablo Payawal, who later  became a prominent law practitioner, and Jose Carlos, who became a Judge, copped the first and second places, respectively, in the 1920 Bar Examinations.</p>
                    
                    <p>Three years later, former Civil Service Commissioner Amado Del Rosario and Cipriano Primicias, who became a majority floor leader in the defunct Senate and who was one of the vice-presidential nominees for the 1961 national elections, followed suit by garnering the second and six places, respectively, in 1922 Bar Examinations. And during the three years that followed, the graduates of the college easily hurdled the Bar with 100 percent passing average. This achievement of the college was so impressive that the pre-war Tribune and Philippine Herald newspapers were all praises for the University of Manila.</p>
                    <p>In 1933, Lope Quimbo, Manuel Alvero, and Guillermo Blanco became the first, second, and tenth placers in the Bar Examinations respectively. In 1936, the college again produced another batch of topnotchers where Teodorico Martin was the sixth placer who became the Dean of the College of Law of the San Sebastian Recoletos-Manila and University of the East.</p>
                    <p>Again, in 1937, Sixto Domondon copped the tenth place in the Bar Examinations. To continue, in 1938, Emmanuel Pelaez who was to become Vice-President of the Philippines, led that year’s Bar Examinations “elite” by copping the first place. With Emmanuel Pelaez there were also two topnotchers, namely Rodegelio Jalandoni, sixth placer, and Pedro Bacerro, the seventh placer in the Bar Examinations. In the 1940, the college again had a fourth placer in the Bar, in the person of Delfin De Vera.</p>
                    <p>During the post-war years, the College of Law reasserted its bar supremacy by producing topnotchers. In 1948, Jose M. Evangelista, who was to become ambassador, placed second and established a record high rating of 95.04 percent. Moreover, this feat was duplicated in 1949 by Dominador R. Aytona who also captured the second place. Senator Aytona became a vice-presidential nominee in 1961 under the Nacionalista Party banner. Two years later, in 1951, Vicente Acsay kept up the excellent performance of the college by notching the first place in the Bar Examinations. The good showing of the college continued, for in 1953, Leonardo Amores, who was to become the illustrious faculty member of the college hit the same spot with the highest rating of 95.03 percent.</p>
                    <p>Up to the present year, the College of Law graduates fared very well in the Bar Examinations with ratings above the national passing percentage. In 2006, the College of Law graduates obtained a 75 percent passing grade in the Bar Examinations, again proving the quality of education being sustained throughout the years by the University of Manila.</p>

                <h1>OVERVIEW OF THE LIBRARY</h1>
                <p>The library is a storage of brilliant ideas and words of people that have shaped the world. The UM library is composed of the Dr. Virgilio De Los Santos Central Library located at the 2nd floor of the Central Library Building, the Engineering Library at the 3rd floor of the same building. Bayani Virata Faylona Law Library (BVFLL) is located at the 2nd floor of the ABE Building. The HRM and Criminology Library (HCL), Business and Education Library (EBL), and the Mariano de los Santos Memorial Museum are housed at the 2nd floor of the Noli-Fili Building. While the Graduate Studies Research Center is located at the ground floor of the same building. Elementary and High School Library (EHL) is found in the Doña Patricia Building.</p>
                
                <p>In order to keep up with the modern trends in library services, the library is using the open-shelf system. The students get the books they need from the shelves, and thus the barrier between readers and books has been removed. The OPAC system is installed at the Central Library that facilitates search for the titles of reading materials.</p>
                
                <p>This system further aids the students and faculty members in the use of library materials. The library maintains inter-library loan relations with a number of other libraries in Metro Manila. Faculty members and students are informed from time to time of new acquisitions. Notices about such acquisitions are posted on the Library Bulletin Board, which is located at the lobby of the Central Library.</p>

It has computer and internet facilities where bonafide students and other university-based users like administrators, faculty and employees are allowed to use the said facilities subject to its rules and regulation. This houses the social sciences collection and the filipiniana section.</p>
            
            <p>The Central library provides internet services. In a fast-paced and highly information conscious world, the use of internet is deemed necessary. Access and retrieval of knowledge has been done through the information highway. The Library and the Computer Center of the University has provided internet terminals for the users. The Chief Librarian and the staff are available to facilitate the use of the internet for the assignment and research work of its users.</p>

            <p>The University of Manila Comprehensive Student Support System (UMCSSS) is divided into three aspects:</p>
            <p>1.management and governance;</p>

            <h2>LRC as an Alternative Learning System</h2>
            <p>The primary goal of the Center is to help students improve their academic performance. Many students do not succeed with traditional methods in large groups or with the standard curriculum’s scope, sequence and pace. Some require heavy remedial work, while others need tutorial assistance or a combination of both approaches.</p>
            <p>Our one-on-one and group class programs are truly individualized for each student. Each program is structured to produce mastery learning, an outstanding self-confidence booster. In addition, resource handouts are available to assist students with study skills, research papers, and a selection of other academic tasks.</p>
