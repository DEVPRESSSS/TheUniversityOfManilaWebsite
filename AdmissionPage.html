                <h1>High School and Elementary Department</h1>
                <p>Admission to the University of Manila is a privilege and not a right. As a general rule, The University of Manila is open only to students whose qualifications indicate satisfactory academic performance and who could meet other admission requirements as heretofore required. In the interest of maintaining academic standards and preserving peace and tranquility in the campus, the University reserves the right to refuse enrollment to any applicant.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
    
        <div class="admission-requirements">
            <h2>Admission Requirements for Elementary and High School Department</h2>
            <p>Old Students should present their last year’s Final Report Card (F-138) or a certificate from their principal to the effect that they passed all the subjects in the previous year.</p>
            <p>New Students for the Elementary (except Grade 1) and High School courses should present a duly accomplished transfer or final report card or high school transcript of records.</p>
        </div>
    
        <div class="admission-policies-details">
            <h2>Admission Policies</h2>
            <p>Credentials submitted for enrollment become permanent portions of the school records and may not be withdrawn after registration.</p>
            <p>Any applicant who is not able to present the credentials required within registration period will be automatically classified as a special student—one who is not entitled to receive college credits for work done during the entire school year, semester, or summer term.</p>
            <p>No student is allowed to enroll in The University of Manila and in another educational institution during the same semester or term under penalty of losing credits in one or in both institutions, unless previously approved by the Commission on Higher Education, and a written permit for the same is recorded in the office of the University Registrar. The permit should state the subjects taken in the other school.</p>
            <p>No student may enroll in an advanced subject or subjects, under penalty of losing credits in the same, before he has completed the corresponding prerequisite subject or subjects in the preceding academic year or years. One should therefore enroll only in subjects duly approved by the respective heads of the department concerned.</p>
            <p>Students are allowed to attend only the classes for which they are duly registered and validly enrolled.</p>
            <p>A student wishing to register for courses in a college, school, or department of the University of Manila other than in which he has already enrolled is required to secure prior approval in writing from the Deans of the colleges, schools, or departments concerned.</p>
            <p>Changes of the courses or subjects, colleges, etc., may be made only upon written approval of the Dean concerned and the University Registrar but in no case after the registration period. Copies of said request for changes of subjects or courses or dropping of same, together with the written approval of the Dean or Heads concerned, should be filed with the Office of the Registrar and the Accounting Division. Changes are effected on the date applications therefore are filed with said offices.</p>
            <p>No credits will be given for: (a) Subjects taken by students for which they did not register as shown by their approved application for enrollment; (b) Subjects taken by students who are not fully qualified to take the same; (c) Subjects not duly approved by the deans or department heads concerned; (d) Subjects taken by special students.</p>
            <p>Payments of school fees is required upon registration and is requisite to valid enrollment.</p>
            <p>In all cases, students should consult the Deans or Department Heads concerned in preparing their program of study.</p>

        <div class="conduct-discipline">
            <h2>Conduct and Discipline</h2>
            <p>The University of Manila expects that a student seeking admission into any of its colleges comes with an honest purpose. For this reason, it is demanded that each student uphold not only the recognized standards of the University pertaining to morality, good conduct, and courtesy, but also the regard of his fellow students and the faculty, and the dignity of the University.</p>
        </div>
    
        <div class="character-guidelines">
            <h2>Character</h2>
            <p>The University of Manila, in order to maintain a high moral standard among its student population invokes the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The University reserves the right to refuse admission:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Of any student found to have been charged in Courts of Justice with any crime involving moral turpitude;</li>
                        <li>Of students who are members of subversive organizations;</li>
                        <li>Of student-transferees who obtained Failures or Incomplete grades in 50% of the academic load of the preceding semester.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>This refusal may apply even to students already admitted and enrolled in the University.</li>
                <li>In case of doubt as to character fitness of an applicant/enrollee, the University authorities have the right to demand from the applicant, clearance from the Police, or other government entities concerned.</li>
                <li>Failure of the student to present required credentials for admission and other supporting documents within the prescribed period will be sufficient cause to invalidate his admission to the University.</li>
                <li>The University may discharge any student for immorality, drunkenness or any gross misconduct against fellow students, faculty members, or administrative officials enumerated in Sec. IX, Par. 217 of the MANUAL OF INFORMATION FOR PRIVATE SCHOOLS.</li>
