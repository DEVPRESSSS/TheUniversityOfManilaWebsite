            <p>“The study of law is generally a preparation of the law students for the bar examinations and ultimately for the practice of law, hence the professors of law should teach in order for the students to learn and not to teach in order to test.” This was stressed by Chairman Hilarion L. Aquino of the Legal Education Board during the First Law Student’s Congress on Legal Education held last December 2, 2011 at the Ateneo Professional Schools, Rockwell, Makati City.</p>
            <p>The Congress served as a platform for the views and responses of select law students from the metropolitan and provincial law schools and legal luminaries on the recent developments in the Philippine Legal Institution, such as the constitution of the Legal Education Board (LEB), the shift to multiple choice type questions for the bar examinations, as well as the expansion of the legal profession.</p>
            <p>The first of its kind in the country and in Asia, the Congress was composed of 4 sessions, each specifically geared towards an important aspect of legal education in recent times. These sessions were: 1. Response to the Results of the Convocation on Legal Education; 2. Feedback on the Concluded 2011 Bar Examinations; 3. Best Practices in Bar Operations; and 4. Career Options: A Guide Towards Responsible and a Globally Sensitive Practice of the Legal Profession.</p>

            <p>The first session was handled by former Justice Hilarion L. Aquino which focused on the new directions of the Legal Education Board relative to law curricula and  selection of faculty members. He said that “faculty members should not only be academically outstanding but also exemplars of proper conduct “. For the second session, Justice Roberto Abad, the 2011 Bar Examinations Chairman, discussed the goals of the new format of the bar examinations. The third session featured the best practices of the bar operations programs of San Beda College of Law and Ateneo Law School. Hon. Agnes Devanadera, former Justice Secretary and Solicitor General, explained the public and private career opportunities in legal education. “Whether to work for the Office of the Solicitor General or the judiciary, the integrity of the legal profession should always be put in our minds,” Devanadera said. “The spirit of the law plus the word of law equals social justice,” the former Justice Secretary added. At the end of the session, speakers from the Asian Law Students’ Association shared their experience of the legal education in their respective countries which put the whole Law Student’s Congress in a global perspective.</p>

                <h1>Bayani virata faylona law library receives international grant

        <div class="admission-requirements">
            <p>The Bayani Virata Faylona Law Library (BVFLL) of the University of Manila recently received an international grant worth one hundred thousand pesos (P 100,000.00) from Mrs. Marilyn Faylona-Cruz, a successful professional in the United States. The cash grant was used to purchase new law books and computers to boost the collections and on-line information services of the 10-year old specialized library.</p>
            <p>In 2002, the renovation of the law library was completed successfully through an endowment given by Faylona’s only daughter, Mrs. Marilyn Faylona-Cruz. “It is my commitment to help the law library since my father studied and taught in the UM College of Law. This is my simple way of giving back to the institution that nurtured so much my father,” Mrs. Cruz said. “As a matter of fact, I included in my will (estate) the BVFLL as a beneficiary,” she added..</p>
            <p>Tracing back, the law library was renamed in honor of the late Atty. Bayani V. Faylona. He graduated from the UM with Bachelor of Laws (Cum laude) in 1949, Bachelor of Arts in 1950, and Master of Laws in 1953. After his studies at UM, he took up Master of Civil Law at Tulane University, New Orleans in 1959. A scholar in the truest sense of the word, he attended various universities abroad for further studies such as the University of Florida, Gainesville; Southwestern Law Center and Academy of American and International Law, Dallas, Texas (USA) in 1966; and the University of California School of Law, Berkeley, California (USA) in 1956; among others.</p>

            <p>The grant was handed over to the University President and Chief Academic Officer, Dr. Emily Dodson de Leon last January 16, 2012 at the BVFLL. Also in attendance during the significant day were Atty. Stephen Scandurro-a graduate of Georgetown University School of Law who accompanied Mrs. Cruz, Dr. Victor T. Cruz-husband of Mrs. Cruz, Atty. Salvador A. Poquiz-Dean of the College of Law, former Judge Pelagio B. Estopia-law faculty member, Dr. Lourdes Sabile-Dean College of Education, Prof. Daniel Atayde-Executive Secretary for College of Law, Ms. Christine Lazaro and Ms. Jacqueline Ferrera-Law Librarians.</p>

            <p>“This grant will really help the services of the law library. The law students and other stakeholders of the University of Manila warmly welcome this humble contribution. Thank you very much,” Dr. Emily de Leon said.

        <div class="admission-requirements">
            <p>In the light of the celebration of the Centennial Anniversary of the University of Manila, the Administration through the perseverance of Madam President, Dr. Emily de Leon and the Alumni Affairs Officials, the Centennial Logo was unveiled on June 27, 2013 at the Dr. Mariano V. de Los Santos Memorial Auditorium.
            </p>
            <p>MEANING OF THE LOGO

                The Blaze of the Future is the official logo for the Centennial celebration of the University of Manila. This logo highlights, in an artistic fashion, the noble ideals, stability, integrity, and 100 years of existence of the University as a catalyst for excellent education and research.</p>

            <p>Inspired by the contemporary challenges and perspectives of the global society, the University adopts the theme: moving beyond excellence in education and research, which rekindles the commitment of the University to uphold and exceed current and future educational and research standards.</p>

            <p>“From the letters UM emanate three dynamic rays which represent the future and triumvirate ideals of the university: Patria, Scientia et Virtus and are reminiscent of the wings of the Hawk, the University’s mascot which has always been associated with the Greek god “Ares”, connoting an unwavering stance toward the achievement of established goals.
            </p>
            <p>The logo is suffused with colors green and gold. Green is life. It signifies growth, renewal, health, and environment. It is also a color of harmony and balance. It represents the University’s commitment to sustain, improve and expand high quality, relevant, transformative, interactive, and collaborative learning systems guided by responsible scholarship and education. Gold symbolizes brilliance, excellence and success. It embodies the University’s persistent pursuit of sustainable excellence.</p>

            <P>Together, the colors green and gold reinforce the University’s vision of making the lives of others better, brighter, lighter, and more livable by making quality education accessible to all.</P>
