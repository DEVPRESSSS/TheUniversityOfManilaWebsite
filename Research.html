            <h2>Overview of High School and Elementary Department</h2>
            <p>The High School and Elementary Department of The University of Manila is considered the oldest unit of this one hundred year old institution of learning, having been opened in the school year 1914-1915. It was started with the purpose of affording an economical opportunity to the youths of Manila and other parts of the Philippines to obtain a thorough education at pre-collegiate levels.</p>
            <p>Physical Education classes are held at the new Physical Education Building which construction reflects the University’s vibrance and relevance as an educational institution attuned to the needs of the 21st century.</p>
            <p>Character development is stressed not only in the classrooms but also in all aspects of the curricular and extra-curricular programs participated in by the students. The Department is aware of the fact that majority of the students enrolled in the Elementary and High School levels are in the most critical period of their lives, that of adolescence.</p>
            <p>Hence, every opportunity is given the students to improve themselves morally, spiritually, and intellectually. Through a well conducted guidance program, students are encouraged to face the future unafraid.</p>

                    <h2>About the College</h2>
                    <p>The College of Liberal Arts of the University of Manila was opened in the school year 1920-1921. It teaches not only the principally courses traditionally embraced by the humanities and social sciences but also trains the students in the skills of a liberal education: learning, reading and writing, and thinking critically in the broad fields of liberal learning- the arts, science, society, philosophy, and religion.</p>
                    
                    <p>Specifically, through a balanced curriculum and a varied but unified program of extra-curricular activities, it aims:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>To train students in correct and creative thinking, judicious appraisal of contemporary problems, effective communication and aesthetic as well as ethical discrimination of values;</li>
                        <li>To give a wide and intensive cultural background preparatory to later professional training in Law, Education, Foreign Service, Business Administration, Public Administration, Military Science or in any other field;</li>
                        <li>To acquaint the students with the significant facts, basic and unifying principles as well as the chief methods of research in the four major areas of human knowledge, namely, the Natural and Social Sciences, Mathematics and the Humanities (with Philosophy, the integrating master science, included);</li>
                        <li>To interest students in the study of research possibilities that are relevant to conditions prevailing in our country.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>On August 3, 2003, the University created history once more, as it received a government permit to offer a four-year Bachelor of Arts in Cultural Languages major in Japanese Language, making the University of Manila the very first institution of higher learning to offer a degree program in Japanese Language.</p>
