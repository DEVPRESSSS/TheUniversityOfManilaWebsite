                    <h2>About the College</h2>
                    <p>The College of Liberal Arts of the University of Manila was opened in the school year 1920-1921. It teaches not only the principally courses traditionally embraced by the humanities and social sciences but also trains the students in the skills of a liberal education: learning, reading and writing, and thinking critically in the broad fields of liberal learning- the arts, science, society, philosophy, and religion.</p>
                    
                    <p>Specifically, through a balanced curriculum and a varied but unified program of extra-curricular activities, it aims:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>To train students in correct and creative thinking, judicious appraisal of contemporary problems, effective communication and aesthetic as well as ethical discrimination of values;</li>
                        <li>To give a wide and intensive cultural background preparatory to later professional training in Law, Education, Foreign Service, Business Administration, Public Administration, Military Science or in any other field;</li>
                        <li>To acquaint the students with the significant facts, basic and unifying principles as well as the chief methods of research in the four major areas of human knowledge, namely, the Natural and Social Sciences, Mathematics and the Humanities (with Philosophy, the integrating master science, included);</li>
                        <li>To interest students in the study of research possibilities that are relevant to conditions prevailing in our country.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>On August 3, 2003, the University created history once more, as it received a government permit to offer a four-year Bachelor of Arts in Cultural Languages major in Japanese Language, making the University of Manila the very first institution of higher learning to offer a degree program in Japanese Language.</p>
