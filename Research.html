                    <p>The University of Manila Research and Development Center started its scholarly activities before World War II by publishing the Student Leader which later became Campus Leader and Law Gazette, (College of Law Journal) after World War II in 1951, the Journal of East Asiatic Studies, (Graduate School Journal) was published.  Dr. Charles O. Houston, Jr. was the editor and Alfonso B. Millena, as associate editor.  The UM Business Logbook (Business Administration and Accountancy) was also published at this time.</p>
                    
                    <p>In the initial issue of the Journal of East Asiatic Studies the following statement of Objective and Purposes was clearly spelled out.  “The University of Manila and the Editor believe that the functions of a university should be much broader in the East than even in West, since so many more problems face the people of the East today, in depth, breadth and gravity, than have faced the peoples of the West for generations.”</p>
                    <p>The University of Manila Research and Development Center started its scholarly activities before World War II by publishing the Student Leader which later became Campus Leader and Law Gazette, (College of Law Journal) after World War II in 1951, the Journal of East Asiatic Studies, (Graduate School Journal) was published.  Dr. Charles O. Houston, Jr. was the editor and Alfonso B. Millena, as associate editor.  The UM Business Logbook (Business Administration and Accountancy) was also published at this time.</p>
                    <p>Such were the prophetic words of the Editor that today, more than forty years later, the developments in the East, now known as the Pacific Rim of the Asia-Pacific Century, according to most futurologists and the recent successful Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit held in the Philippines pointed toward only one direction: the march to economic prosperity and political stability in the region.</p>
                    <p>Continuing this Journal’s objectives and purposes, we in the present Research and Development Center hope to “present the results of specialized studies by scholars all over the world, in all disciplines and on all subjects related to peoples, the countries, the traditions, in history, the ideas—all aspects of life and living, their bases and influencing factors in the Orient.  It intends to bring them together for students and scholars, in the Orient and elsewhere; thus, contribute, in a humble fashion, to the extension and broadening of men’s knowledge about the world in which he lives.</p>
                    <p>We therefore look forward to improving the context and quality of our publications and thereby institutionalize the research programs of the university under one central organization.</p>
                    <p>With the new setup, the university hopes to achieve its goal of globalization involving all departments in this undertaking.</p>

                    <h2>RESEARCH VISION AND MISSION</h2>
                    
                    <p>The University of Manila since 1913 has consistently given emphasis to research endeavors as its major thrust in its educational work.  To be globally competitive, the school should be research-oriented and therefore must contribute to the unending search for knowledge in all fields of human endeavor to prove its mettle.</p>
                    <p>In aspiring for its rightful place in this world of highly competitive globalization, students are required to submit research study.</p>
                    <p>The university faculty is likewise motivated to produce research undertakings useful not only to themselves but also to the community.</p>
                    <p>The non-academic members of the UM community are likewise encouraged to do research work to enable them to attain self-improvement and to contribute their share in institution building.</p>
