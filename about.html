                <h1>Our University Heritage</h1>
                <p>The University of Manila stands as a beacon of academic excellence and cultural pride in the heart of the Philippines. Founded with a vision to nurture the Filipino intellect and spirit, we have consistently upheld our commitment to quality education for over a century.</p>

            <h2>Message from the University President</h2>
            
            <p>With the opening of the school year, The UNIVERSITY OF MANILA once again accepts into its fold a new influx of students. It welcomes back the upperclassmen who are now more familiar with its policies and are ready to cope with the different intricacies of college life.</p>
            
            <p>Dr. Mariano V. de los Santos together with two other men and a woman founded the UM as the INSTITUTO DE MANILA in 1913 as an exponent of PHILIPPINE nationalism and culture. They labored tenaciously with an abiding faith and incurable optimism for an educational system to thrive which would produce the noblest in the Filipino.</p>
            
            <p>Since its inception, the University has sought to educate its students with the sublime trilogy of <span class="motto">Patria, Scientia et Virtus</span>. UM therefore, can be likened to a fertile ground where you can cultivate and nourish your dreams.</p>
            
            <p>However, these dreams can only be achieved by strictly adhering to the law of success. First, you must define your goals. Most of mankind get born and die without ever knowing what they really want. Second, you must develop a positive outlook in life. Challenges are what makes a man. Face it, and even if you lose time and again, you'll emerge wiser each time. Avoid it and you're a loser through and through. Remember, problems are often opportunities in disguise. Third, always follow the credo: To thine own self be true. For in the end you are most answerable to yourselves and not to any jury. You have to put your heart, your soul, all the good that there is in you in every endeavor you undertake. You must be, as that old poems goes, "in a constant struggle to attain a place on earth and a good name".</p>
            
            <p>You are therefore fortunate to be with us, as you will be the heirs of a well-guarded tradition of excellence which has been the hallmark of this institution.</p>

                    <div class="history-text">
                        <p>On October 5, 1913, a group of four young men and a woman, with ages from fifteen to twenty-one met for breakfast at the Palma de Mallorca, a popular restaurant beside the Sto. Domingo Church in Intramuros, Manila.</p>
                        <p>The five were Dr. Apolinario G. de los Santos, his brother, Dr. Mariano V. de los Santos, his sister, Maria de los Santos, and two friends Dr. Buenaventura J. Bello and Atty. Antonio Rivero. They were only college students then, who were more daring than their contemporaries for they were determined to pursue their dream of putting up a school suited to the needs of the Filipino youth.</p>
                        <p>These impecunious young people, as they were called by the university historian, encountered many challenges in realizing their dream of establishing an institution whose motto was "Patria, Scientia, et Virtus. They named their school Instituto de Manila, after the city of their affection and Apolinario de los Santos was elected as the first director of the school.</p>

                <p>The doors of the Instituto de Manila were first opened in school year 1914-1915. The forerunner of this institution offered only elementary and high school courses in a leased building located at the corner of Madrid and Peñarubia streets, Binondo District. However, in school year 1919-1920, in order to accommodate its growing populace and to provide them with better facilities, the Instituto de Manila started conducting classes in its own building at the Sampaloc District.</p>
                
                <p>Before embarking on a program of expansion in order to meet the educational needs of its constituency, the Instituto de Manila had to undergo internal changes. On the occasion of its eighth anniversary, the original incorporators unanimously agreed to effect a reorganization geared towards the attainment of a university status. As a result, the Instituto de Manila was re-incorporated as the University of Manila on November 3, 1921 under the provisions of Act No. 1459 of the former Philippine Legislature.</p>

                <h2>Growth and Expansion</h2>
                <p>Right after its re-incorporation, the University focused on providing more course offerings for their growing clientele. The growth and expansion marked the turning point of this democratic and dynamic institution which has withstood the test of time. The University has survived two world wars and the bewildering changes in the country and of the world: ideological, social, economic, and political.</p>
