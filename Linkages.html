            <h2>Mission of the Learning Resource Center (LRC)</h2>
            <p>The University of Manila has established strong educational, cultural, and business linkages with local and international institutions to respond synergistically to the challenges of global education and the increasing impact of knowledge society.</p>
            <p>Through the dynamic leadership of the President, Dr. Emily Dodson De Leon, the University has maintained sisterhood agreements with different Asian universities, namely Dohto University of Saporro and Monbatsu cities of Hokkaido, Japan; Tokai University of Tokyo Japan; Hansun University of Seoul, Korea; Cheng Kung Commercial and Technical High School of Pate City, Taiwan, Republic of China; and most recently with Meio University of Nago City, Okinawa, Japan, and Cheongui University of South Korea and Phuket Rajabhat University, Thailand.</p>
            <p>Under these agreements, selected students from foreign countries as well as professors in various disciplines 
                come to study and teach at UM while UM students and faculty are equally sent to Japan and Korea under the mutual continuing agreement of 
                UM and the Japanese and Korean Universities.</p>

            <p>Further, the University has recognized long before the need for membership with the industry-based associations to benchmark standards and practices. 
                The University is an active member of the International Association of Universities (IAU) in Paris, France; Association of Southeast Asian Institutions of Higher Learning (ASAIHL) in Bangkok, Thailand; Philippine Association of Colleges and Universities (PACU); University-Belt Consortium; Philippine Society for Educational Research and Evaluation (PSERE);
                 Philippine Association of Teacher Education (PAFTE); Philippine Association of Graduate Education (PAGE); and many others.</p>

            <p>Since 1913 to the present, the University has served not only the Filipino youth but also those students of other countries who have chosen this formidable institution as their second home in their educational pursuit. As the University celebrates its 100 years of existence, 
                it rekindles its strong commitment to serve mankind through excellent education and research.</p>
